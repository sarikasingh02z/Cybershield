CyberShield
Experimental Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using Machine Learning
CyberShield is an experimental, research-oriented Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) that investigates how threshold tuning and error analysis affect detection reliability in machine learning–based security systems under imbalanced network traffic.
Rather than presenting a production-ready security system, this project focuses on methodological evaluation, controlled experimentation, and interpretability of model behavior, which are critical for applied machine learning research in cybersecurity.

Research Motivation
Machine learning–based intrusion detection systems often report strong accuracy in offline evaluation, yet default decision thresholds frequently lead to unstable performance, excessive false positives, or missed attacks in realistic traffic distributions.

Research Question: How does confidence threshold tuning influence false-positive rates and detection stability in a dual-model intrusion detection system trained on imbalanced network traffic?

CyberShield is intentionally designed as an experimental testbed to analyze this question through systematic evaluation.
